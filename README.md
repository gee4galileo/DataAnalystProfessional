## üìç Professional Certificate - 9 course series
Prepare for a career in the **high-growth field of data analytics.** In this program, I learned in-demand skills like Python, Excel, and SQL to get job-ready.

Data analysis is the process of collecting, storing, modeling, and analyzing data that can inform executive decision-making, and the **demand for skilled data analysts has never been greater.**

This program taught me the foundational data skills employers are seeking for entry-level data analytics roles. It not only helped me start my career in data analytics but also **provided a strong foundation** for future career development in other paths such as data science, artificial intelligence, deep learning, or data engineering. 

I learned the latest skills and tools used by professional data analysts including Excel spreadsheets, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebooks, Cognos Analytics, and more. I worked with a variety of data sources and project scenarios to **gain practical experience** with data manipulation and applying analytical skills.

When I completed the full program, I had a portfolio of projects and a Professional Certificate from IBM to showcase my expertise. I also earned an IBM Digital badge and gained access to career resources to help me in my job search, including mock interviews and resume support. 

This program was ACE¬Æ recommended.

**Applied Learning Project:**

Throughout the program, I completed hands-on projects and labs and gained a firm grasp of the required technical skills to effectively gather, wrangle, mine, and visualize data, as well as the soft skills for working with stakeholders and storytelling with data to engage my audience.

**Projects**
- Imported, cleaned, and analyzed fleet vehicle inventory with Excel pivot tables
- Used car sales key performance indicator (KPI) data to create an interactive dashboard with visualizations
- Extracted and graphed financial data with the Pandas data analysis Python library
- Used SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets
- Wrangled data, graphed plots, and created regression models to predict housing prices with data science Python libraries
- Created a dynamic Python dashboard to monitor, report, and improve US domestic flight reliability

At the end of the program, I completed a real-world capstone project specifically designed to showcase my newly learned data analyst skills.
